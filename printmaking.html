Those who go extra miles and get themselves to working zones are the ones that usually and commonly make a better future for themselves Your success can never be on your comfort zone, get there into a danger and discomfort zone and grab what is good and comes your way. We don’t actually recognize what opportunities can make us be what we want to be for instance it is common that every child is sent to school, that’s the first opportunity that is given and some are born to just use what they have and be successful, be consistent on your goal and look what you will harvest at the end, grab what comes your way, use your living time effectively, you not born to be poor go out there, rather look like a fool if it takes to, to spoon yourself.

                        <div><img title="YOUR MIND,YOUR ENGINE . What you put in mind is the result of the person you are. Best motivation comes from you and the best motivator is you. The text written on the art work speaks of the brain like a soil to decide what you plant in. The choice is all yours. Remember a good germination of a plant need watering, sunlight and a fertile soil. Be advised to take good choices about your self. Be protective of what comes in of your mind, most people are spiritually dead because of the things they grabbed not realizing they are to kill their capability, their strength and power of the engine,  brain. As long as you live , start again.
