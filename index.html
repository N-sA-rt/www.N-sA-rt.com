                            My inspiration for creating art comes from hardartist-statementing individuals. My
                            artartist-statements are a reflection of the daily inspirations I experience,
                            particularly the drive to artist-statement hard to put food on the table despite a
                            difficult upbringing. My artartist-statement is built on inspiring people and
                            providing them with a sense of hope that will keep them going and
                            keep them striving for more. My pieces of art entice the audience to do
                            more investigation and learn more because they raise questions and
                            contain symbolism.
                            My audience consists of both those who have overcome numerous
                            obstacles and have artist-statemented hard to get where they are and those who
                            are still in school as a means of surviving and succeeding. My artartist-statement
                            expands more on my discoveries as an artist and proves that hard artist-statement
                            pays off. My artartist-statement should, in my expectation and hope, inspire
                            amazement, joy, excitement, motivation, and cheerfulness.

                            better understand and apply some techniques.
                            on printmaking and painting there is variation of symbols. On
                            printmaking I used woodblocks and on painting, self stretched canvases
                            with rough and smooth primed texture to commemorate the viewer to
                            the walked journey up to this far. They create thinking and imagination
                            time. I am inspired by many artists, and I will mention few like Andrew
                            Ntshabele, Donald Kilpatrick and Solomon Omolayo Omogboye.</li>
